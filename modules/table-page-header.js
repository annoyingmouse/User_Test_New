      <h1>Thank you again <small>for taking part in this test, you're very nearly done.</small></h1>
      <p>If you can see a table below with 4 people in it (Doctors 08 08 (08/08/0808), 09 09 (09/09/0909), 10 10 (10/10/1010) and 11 11 (11/11/1111)) then you're ready to go. We'd like you to add some details for the family. You (as Dr 08 08) have brown hair, brown eyes and you're left-handed. The rest of your family has these details:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dr. 09 09 is really rather odd with silver eyes, white hair and is ambidextrous (I'm not sure I'd trust them <abbr title="To Be Honest">TBH</abbr>).</li>
        <li>Dr. 10 10, perhaps due to being ambilevous, had a rather tragic accident and has no eyes or hair as a result.</li>
        <li>Dr. 11 11 is right-handed and has brown hair and eyes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you could provide the details and be mindful about how the process feels to you, perhaps in relation to how the other version felt if you've already entered the data there, then get back to us we'd be really grateful. I'll be sharing this on Facebook so a comment there will suffice but please try entering the data in both ways before commenting.</p>
      <p>We appreciate that the scenario is contrived but it's just a made up use case, no data you enter is saved to a server, it's all in the browser - though the initial page does make use of local storage so that the details of the family are maintained between sessions.</p>
